A time triggered annotation site for video.

tubeGenius allows users to add comments to YouTube videos that will be triggered at user-specified times within that video. It functions similarly to time triggered comments on Soundcloud.

This functionality was achieved with Mozilla's Popcorn.js library (with some slight modifications).

Please check this out for a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwPa72gAZ8

The project is currently hosted on Heroku: http://tubegenius.herokuapp.com/
